## Who am I?

I am a neuroscientist with 7 years of experience in experimental design, data science, and deep/machine learning. I've worked with various forms of biological data, including wearable sensor time-series data during my Data Analysis internship at Evidation Health and neural time-series data for my PhD research, where I used deep and machine learning to analyze neural representations during cognitive flexiblity.

I'm skilled at building/optimizing analysis pipelines to independently distill insights from complex biological datasets and communicate them to cross-functional audiences. I'm driven to produce meaningful and actionable insight from data; I've spent years in self-directed study to add to my analytical toolbox.

## Projects

1. My manuscript "Circuit inhibition promotes the dynamic reorganization of prefrontal task encoding to support cognitive flexibility" is being submitted to a preprint server!

2. <a href="http://www.moviesofsanfrancisco.info/"> I recently created an interactive map of film locations in San Francisco as a side project. Check it out here! </a>

3. Open source post hoc statistical annotation in development: <a href="https://github.com/cjohnsoncruz/plot_posthoc_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link to /plot_stat_annot repo</a>

4. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/djcarloscruzsf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I also DJ in my spare time. </a>
