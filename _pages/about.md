  I am a neuroscience researcher with 7 years of experience in experimental design, data science, and deep/machine learning. My work experience spans various topic areas, including a Data Analysis internship analyzing wearable sensor data at Evidation Health and a PhD thesis using machine learning on neuroimaging time-series data to understand the neurobiology of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.
  
   I'm skilled at building and optimizing analysis pipelines to independently distill insights from complex datasets and communicate them to technical and non-technical stakeholders. I am driven to produce work providing meaningful and actionable insight to others; to that end, I have spent years in self-directed study to learn deep and machine-learning techniques to add to my analytical toolbox.

I have recently created an interactive map of film locations in San Francisco. Check it out <a href="http://www.moviesofsanfrancisco.info/">here</a>!
   
  Projects in progress:

   1) Manuscript on the contribution of interneurons to neural encoding in mouse frontal cortex during cognitive flexibility in development:
